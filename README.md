**BIGMART SALES PREDICTION**

## project overview
The BigMart Sales Prediction project aims to predict the sales of various products across different BigMart stores using historical data. By analyzing key factors such as store type, location, product visibility, and more, we use machine learning techniques to build models that accurately forecast sales.
This project can be helpful for store managers and decision-makers to optimize product placement, stock levels, and overall sales strategies.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is from BigMart Sales Data, containing attributes like:
Item Identifier: Unique ID for products
Item Weight: Weight of the item
Item Visibility: The visibility of the product in the store
Item Type: The category to which the item belongs
Outlet Identifier: Unique ID for the store
Outlet Location Type: Location type of the store (Urban, Rural, etc.)
Outlet Type: The type of outlet (Supermarket Type1, Type2, etc.)
Sales: Sales of the product (Target variable)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

### Explanation of Key Folders:
- **README.md**: Contains the project overview, installation instructions, and other information.
- **LICENSE**: Project license information (optional but recommended).
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies that can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **/data**: Contains both raw and processed data used in the project.
  - **raw**: Unprocessed data files.
  - **processed**: Cleaned and prepared data files for machine learning models.
- **/src**: Contains Python scripts for different stages of the project, including:
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for data cleaning and feature engineering.
  - `model_training.py`: Script for training machine learning models.
  - `model_evaluation.py`: Script for evaluating the performance of the trained models.
- **/notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and other interactive work.
- **/docs**: Documentation or reports related to the project (e.g., final project report).

This structure provides an organized and clear way to manage files, making collaboration easier for your team. You can adjust it based on the complexity and needs of your project.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluated the performance of the following models to predict sales:

### Models
1. **Linear Regression**
   - A basic regression model used as a benchmark for comparison.
   
2. **Random Forest**
   - An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
   
3. **XGBoost**
   - An advanced boosting algorithm designed for high performance and accuracy.
